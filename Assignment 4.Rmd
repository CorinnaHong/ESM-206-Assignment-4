1. Lobster abundance and fishing pressure (2012 - 2017)

```{r}

# Create five graphs of each location with years on the x-axis and count of lobsters on y-axis

abundance_summary <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  count(YEAR) # Count how many observations there are in each year (data is grouped by site)
abundance_summary

abundance_col <- ggplot(abundance_summary, aes(x = YEAR, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ SITE)
abundance_col

# Create graphs of trap buoys versus year at each site

trap_summary <- lobster_traps %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  count(YEAR) # Count how many observations there are in each year (data is grouped by site)
trap_summary

trap_col <- ggplot(trap_summary, aes(x = YEAR, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ SITE)
trap_col

```

2. Compare mean lobster size by site in 2017 

```{r}
# QUestion: Is there a significant difference in mean lobster size between the five sites

#H0: THere is no significant difference in mean lobster size between the five sites
#HA: There is a significant difference in mean lobster size between the five sites

# One-way ANOVA: We should use a one-way ANOVA, and need to test for normality (sample sizes are over 30 so we can use the central limit theorem) and equal variance (levene's test)

size_2017 <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  filter(YEAR == 2017) %>% 
  select(SITE, SIZE)

##Levene's Test:

## DO LEVENE'S TEST HERE

variances <- size_2017 %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(SIZE),
    sd = sd(SIZE),
    variance = var(SIZE)
  )

lobster_levene <- leveneTest(SIZE ~ SITE, data = size_2017)
lobster_levene
  
# ?? Are variances equal? 

#ONE-WAY ANOVA:

lobster_aov <- aov(SIZE ~ SITE, data = size_2017)
lobster_sum_aov <- summary(lobster_aov)
lobster_sum_aov

lobster_ph <- TukeyHSD(lobster_aov)
lobster_ph


```

Mean lobster size for Adelie (mean ± sd, n = ), Gentoo (mean ± sd, n = ), and Chinstrap (mean ± sd, n =) penguins all differed significantly across all groups by one-way ANOVA (F(`r aov2$parameter`) = `r aov2$statistic`, *p* < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05) with post-hoc pairwise comparison by Bonferroni correction (p < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons).

```{r}

lobster_box <- ggplot(size_2017, aes(x = SITE, y = SIZE)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = SITE, colour = SITE), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  ylab("Mean Lobster Size (mm)") +
  ggtitle("Lobster Sizes by Site (2017)") +
  xlab("Site") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))
lobster_box
